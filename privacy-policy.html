<p>AiGameDev.com KG (“AiGameDev”) operates several websites including aigamedev.com, gameaiconf.com, and aisandbox.com. It is AiGameDev’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.</p>

<h3>Conference Attendees </h3>

<p>All the presentations, panels, other sessions, questions and answers, as well as discussions and public activity in the venues are recorded as audio and video (Content). By attending or registering for the Game/AI Conference (Event), you hereby grant, and you represent and warrant that you have the right to grant, to AiGameDev.com KG an irrevocable, perpetual, exclusive, transferable, fully paid, worldwide license (with the right to sublicense) to use, copy, publicly perform, publicly display, edit, transcribe, translate, excerpt (in whole or in part) and distribute such Content for any purpose on or in connection with the Event the promotion thereof, to prepare derivative works of, or incorporate into other works, such Content, and to grant and authorize sublicenses of the foregoing. </p>

<h3>Website Visitors</h3>
<p>Like most website operators, AiGameDev collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. AiGameDev’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how AiGameDev’s visitors use its website. Occasionally, AiGameDev may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>

<p>AiGameDev also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged-in users. AiGameDev only discloses logged-in user IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that blog commenter IP addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog where the comment was left.</p>

<h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
<p>Certain visitors to AiGameDev’s websites choose to interact with AiGameDev in ways that require AiGameDev to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that AiGameDev gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for an account at aigamedev.com to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with AiGameDev &mdash; by purchasing memberships, conference tickets or standalone products, for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions.</p>

<p>In each case, AiGameDev collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with AiGameDev. AiGameDev does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>

<h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3>
<p>AiGameDev may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, AiGameDev may monitor the most popular posts on its blog, or posts in the forums. AiGameDev may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, AiGameDev does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>

<h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
<p>AiGameDev discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on AiGameDev’s behalf or to provide services available at AiGameDev’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using AiGameDev’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. AiGameDev will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone.

<p>Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, AiGameDev discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when AiGameDev believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of AiGameDev, third parties or the public at large.

<p>If you are a registered user of an AiGameDev website and have supplied your email address, AiGameDev may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with AiGameDev and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. AiGameDev takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>

AiGameDev uses cookies to help AiGameDev identify and track visitors, their usage of AiGameDev website, and their website access preferences. AiGameDev visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using AiGameDev’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of AiGameDev’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>

<h3>Business Transfers</h3>
<p>If AiGameDev, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that AiGameDev goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of AiGameDev may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>

<h3>Ads</h3>
<p>Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by AiGameDev and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>

<h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, AiGameDev may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in AiGameDev’s sole discretion.
