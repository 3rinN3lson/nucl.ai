      The nucl.ai Conference is the largest worldwide event focused on applications of Artificial Intelligence in Creative Industries. Join us in Vienna this July for three action-packed days!
    text: >
      <p>Now in its 8th edition, the nucl.ai Conference 2016 on July 18-20 will bring together hundreds of developers, artists, designers, hackers, designers, creative coders working on AI—ranging from robotics to games, visual effects to architecture, mobile apps to online bots, simulations or exhibits. All these fields come together once a year to share ideas and techniques!</p>
      <p>Machine Learning is playing an increasingly big role every year at nucl.ai. From recognizing patterns sensory inputs, automating and optimizing decisions-making in real-time games, or generating assets for use in simulation.</p>
