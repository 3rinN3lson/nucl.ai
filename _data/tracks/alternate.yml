- title: "Living-Room Augmented Reality and Project Trains"
  description: >
    <p>As goggle-based AR slowly matures, there's a window of opportunity for projector-based AR experiences.  It's also a great way to learn about the technology and the impacts on design required to pull off augmented reality in practice &mdash; with a setup that works reliably now already!</p>
    <p>This short tutorial about <a href="http://project-trains.tumblr.com/">Project Trains</a> will show some of the biggest lessons learned from building an interactive living room experience from two kids, from the computer vision aspect to the crafting (litterally) of a projector-based experience with augmented toy tracks.</p>
