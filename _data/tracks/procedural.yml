- title: "Building A Galaxy: Procedural Generation in No Man's Sky"
  description: >
    <p>No Man's Sky is a science-fiction game about exploration and survival set in a vast procedurally generated galaxy. This case study summarises the numerous challenges we have faced in creating a dynamic game world which is not only varied and interesting but also consistent and artist-driven.</p>
    <p>This talk will discuss our approach to on-the-fly procedural content generation, from the scale of a solar system down to tiny planetary details. We'll explain how overlapping systems can work in concert, demonstrating the effectiveness of straightforward generation techniques as well as highlighting areas where more tailored approaches have proved effective.</p>

- title: "Generating Global Cultures and Characters in ULTIMA RATIO REGUM"
  description: >
    This talk explores the extensive and highly unusual procedural generation in the in-development roguelike game Ultima Ratio Regum, the systems underlying the game's creation of a vast range of possible national, cultural and religious identities, and how the game's AI actors draw upon these cultural identities and logics when making their decisions. The talk will explore: the fundamental generation algorithms underlying the construction of the world map, settlements, and the interiors of buildings; the variants of these generators and the interaction of hand-made content into the procedural generators; resolving conflicts at the macro, meso and micro scale in the world's construction; the procedural generation of "culture"; the integration of AIs with these procedural cultures; and handling decision-making for large numbers of AI actors whose decisions must factor in a range of semantic, linguistic, religious and national concerns.

- title: "Procedural Generation of Biotopes for Large Realistic Terrains"
  description: >
    <p>The VBS 3 engine, based on Bohemia Interactive's ARMA, is famous for its realistic depiction of large terrains in training and simulations.  To reach that level of quality with low-overheads, the team relies on a variety of procedural tools and techniques.</p>
    <p>This talk will dig into techniques for synthesizing biotopes in the terrain, what tools are necessary to do so, which parameters are exposed and used.  Also, how can techniques be split for runtime use and which are used during development only?</p>
