- title: "Behavior design for an operational military simulation"
  description: >
    This talk will focus on the process to create behavior for military training simulations. 
    When using simulations to confront trainees to face complex situations, 
    the modeling of realistic automated forces becomes essential. 
    From analysis of miltary decisional processes to behavior modeling, 
    testing and validation the process necessitates the collaboration between the simulation and the operationnal experts. 
    This talk will be illustrated by example from MASA SWORD, a training simulation used throughout the world.
