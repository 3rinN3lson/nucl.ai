- title: "Behavior design for an operational military simulation"
  description: >
    This talk will focus on the process to create behavior for military training simulations. 
    When using simulations to confront trainees to face complex situations, 
    the modeling of realistic automated forces becomes essential. 
    From analysis of miltary decisional processes to behavior modeling, 
    testing and validation the process necessitates the collaboration between the simulation and the operationnal experts. 
    This talk will be illustrated by example from MASA SWORD, a training simulation used throughout the world.
  
- title: "Orchestration of virtual environments for training in complex sociotechnical situations"
  description: >
    The current state-of-the-art on virtual environments allows us to envision their use for training purposes. 
    We can conceive autonomous worlds where learners can experiment, discover and learn the outcomes of their decisions. 
    Though, it is important that this autonomy stay manageable to achieve pedagogical relevance and coherency of the world.
    
    The talk will present the HUMANS platform (Human models based Artificial eNvironments Software platform) whose purpose is 
    to dynamically orchestrate a virtual environment towards learning situations without impairing the world coherency nor the 
    emergence of new and unpredicted situations. The HUMANS platform relies on the modelling of human and social activities 
    leveraging highly complex artificial intelligence techniques in various domains, such as knowledge representation (ontologies), 
    uncertainty processing in complex systems and decisional artificial intelligence (automated planning, plan recognition, multiagent systems).
