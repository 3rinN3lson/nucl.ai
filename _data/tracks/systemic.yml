  description: >
    The track keynote looks into Crowd Simulation for Feature Film, in particular how this is implemented at Industrial Light & Magic. We'll hone in on some recent crowd work for BOND SPECTRE where we were tasked to assist recreating a vibrant Mexico City's Day Of The Dead for the films opening sequence.

- title: "Animal House: Creating Systemic Animal Companions in Far Cry Primal"
  description: >
    Ubisoft's recently released title Far Cry Primal introduced 17 animal companions, many of which had unique abilities and play styles. This talk will describe the development process the team undertook from conception to design to implementation, to create what is now known as the Beast Master feature. Attendees will leave with an understanding of our team’s approach to multi-studio development, our battles with systemic vs. directed behaviours, and how we overcame struggles to achieve the dream of creating the ultimate "weapon".

- title: "Generating and Evaluating Variety for Crowd Simulation"
  description: >
    In this talk I will present recent research from Trinity College Dublin and Disney Research on variety in crowd animation. I’ll talk about the way in which people perceive human bodies, motions and behaviors, and how best to reuse resources (e.g., models, mocap data, audio…) in such a way as to maximize the impression of a heterogeneous crowd of people. The talk will also explore how best to evaluate the realism of the resulting crowd simulations, both quantitatively and qualitatively (e.g., through perceptual experiments).

- title: "Automated Game Balancing"
  description: >
    History has shown that players keep playing balanced games as balanced games continue to challenge players to try different strategies, because none are dominant. 
    Automated game balancing is the next level of game balancing. In the 21st century with numerous games hitting the market, using automated game balancing can make a game 
    stand out of the crowd. Ludible developed this technique that gives the game designer control over all game values by only having to think in terms of game constraints, 
    like: “You should be able to reach the age of 60 even by making the most unhealthy choices”, rather than “The value of ‘x’ should be 1.2 instead of 1.1”.
    In this talk I will show how automated game balancing works and how to let the game logic work as it was intended by the game designer, 
    even though the game constraints can be subject to change. I will speak in detail about the AI players, simulation techniques and of course the dynamic balancing algorithm.

- title: "(Mis)adventures in Building Smarter Tools: AI-Driven Automated Testing"
  description: >
    Wisdom gathered from our attempts at using learning and AI to help out in production, with a focus on passing the responsibility of automated testing to an AI. 
    What worked (and what didn't) in trying to alleviate QA workload and get better feature coverage.

- title: "Intelligent Tools for Game Designers"
  description: >
    In this talk, I will present the results of, and lessons learned on the development of intelligent tools to support designers in their creative design process.  Through the lense of four case studies, you'll learn about strengths and weaknesses of automated tools and human designers, and how they can complement each other.  In addition to discussing the results and insights from this project, I will also briefly outline how we plan to address remaining and new challenges in a new applied research project, called Live Game Design.

- title: "It’s in the Vents: The AI of Alien Isolation"
  description: >
    Alien Isolation relies on systemic AI to deliver tension and scares.  We look at the
    processes, techniques and decisions involved in delivering a systemic experience
    that would traditionally be scripted.
