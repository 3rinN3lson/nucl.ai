- title: "It’s in the Vents: The AI of Alien Isolation"
  description: >
    Alien Isolation relies on systemic AI to deliver tension and scares.  We look at the
    processes, techniques and decisions involved in delivering a systemic experience
    that would traditionally be scripted.

  description: >
    In this talk we'll explore crowd simulation for feature film and look at how this has evolved over the years at Industrial Light & Magic. 
    We'll hone in on some recent work discussing techniques and best practices for animating masses of characters.

  - title: "Intelligent Tools for Game Designers"
  description: >
    In this talk, I will present the results of, and lessons learned from the Dutch applied research project ‘Automated Game Design’ (March 2013 - December 2015), 
    which focused on the use and development of intelligent tools to support game designers in their creative design process.
    Besides researchers from the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences, the TU Delft, and NHTV Breda, this project (financially supported by SIA) involved 13 Dutch game companies, 
    two international partners as advisory board (ITU Copenhagen and UC Santa Cruz), and the Dutch Games Association and the Dutch Game Garden, 
    two organizations supporting the Dutch game industry. 
    The project has analyzed the needs of professional game designers in the participating companies and has contributed to solutions for these needs in the form of formalizations 
    of game design elements and dynamics, and the development of tools for automated game design. Furthermore, these formalizations and tools have been used in case studies 
    with four of the participating Dutch game companies: Wild Card Games, Codeglue, Firebrush Studios, and IC3D Media. The case studies with Wild Card Games and Codeglue 
    addressed mixed-initiative design for level generation (dungeons for the game Dwarf Quest, and multiplayer battle arenas for the game Antegods, respectively). 
    The case study with Firebrush Studios, on the game MoneyMaker Deluxe, addressed the challenges of generation methods for emergent economical processes and phenomena. 
    Finally, the case study with IC3D media involved the development of tools for live prototyping a game, i.e., changing the game dynamics while the game is running. 
    Together, these case studies have led to insights into the strengths and weaknesses of automated tools and human designers, and how they can complement each other. 
    In addition to discussing the results and insights from this project, I will also briefly outline how we plan to address remaining and new challenges in a new applied research project, 
    called Live Game Design.

  - title: "Automated Game Balancing"
  description: >
    History has shown that players keep playing balanced games as balanced games continue to challenge players to try different strategies, because none are dominant. 
    Automated game balancing is the next level of game balancing. In the 21st century with numerous games hitting the market, using automated game balancing can make a game 
    stand out of the crowd. Ludible developed this technique that gives the game designer control over all game values by only having to think in terms of game constraints, 
    like: “You should be able to reach the age of 60 even by making the most unhealthy choices”, rather than “The value of ‘x’ should be 1.2 instead of 1.1”.
    In this talk I will show how automated game balancing works and how to let the game logic work as it was intended by the game designer, 
    even though the game constraints can be subject to change. I will speak in detail about the AI players, simulation techniques and of course the dynamic balancing algorithm.
