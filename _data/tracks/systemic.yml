- title: "Generating and Evaluating Variety for Crowd Simulation"
  description: >
    In this talk I will present recent research from Trinity College Dublin and Disney Research on variety in crowd animation. I’ll talk about the way in which people perceive human bodies, motions and behaviors, and how best to reuse resources (e.g., models, mocap data, audio…) in such a way as to maximize the impression of a heterogeneous crowd of people. The talk will also explore how best to evaluate the realism of the resulting crowd simulations, both quantitatively and qualitatively (e.g., through perceptual experiments).

- title: "Crowd Control for Feature Film at ILM"
  description: >
    In this talk we'll explore crowd simulation for feature film and look at how this has evolved over the years at Industrial Light & Magic. 
    We'll hone in on some recent work discussing techniques and best practices for animating masses of characters.

- title: "Automated Game Balancing"
  description: >
    History has shown that players keep playing balanced games as balanced games continue to challenge players to try different strategies, because none are dominant. 
    Automated game balancing is the next level of game balancing. In the 21st century with numerous games hitting the market, using automated game balancing can make a game 
    stand out of the crowd. Ludible developed this technique that gives the game designer control over all game values by only having to think in terms of game constraints, 
    like: “You should be able to reach the age of 60 even by making the most unhealthy choices”, rather than “The value of ‘x’ should be 1.2 instead of 1.1”.
    In this talk I will show how automated game balancing works and how to let the game logic work as it was intended by the game designer, 
    even though the game constraints can be subject to change. I will speak in detail about the AI players, simulation techniques and of course the dynamic balancing algorithm.

  description: >
    Wisdom gathered from our attempts at using learning and AI to help out in production, with a focus on passing the responsibility of automated testing to an AI. 
    What worked (and what didn't) in trying to alleviate QA workload and get better feature coverage.

- title: "Intelligent Tools for Game Designers"
  description: >
    In this talk, I will present the results of, and lessons learned on the development of intelligent tools to support designers in their creative design process.  Through the lense of four case studies, you'll learn about strengths and weaknesses of automated tools and human designers, and how they can complement each other.  In addition to discussing the results and insights from this project, I will also briefly outline how we plan to address remaining and new challenges in a new applied research project, called Live Game Design.

- title: "It’s in the Vents: The AI of Alien Isolation"
  description: >
    Alien Isolation relies on systemic AI to deliver tension and scares.  We look at the
    processes, techniques and decisions involved in delivering a systemic experience
    that would traditionally be scripted.
