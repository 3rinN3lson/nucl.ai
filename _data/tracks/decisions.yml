- title: "Expanding the Frontier of Environment Query Systems"
  description: >
    As spatial query systems such as EQS (Unreal Engine 4), TPS (CryEngine), and PQS (Luminous Studio) have matured, 
    auto-generated spatial queries are increasingly relied upon for robust dynamic position selection. We present a 
    series of techniques and extensions to these systems used by Square Enix to produce novel behaviors and improve 
    position selection in our current generation of AAA RPG titles. In addition, we have expanded UE4â€™s Environment 
    Query System to serve as a general-purpose utility system; we show how minor modifications allowed the team to 
    use EQS to coordinate combat, reduce behavior tree complexity with a hybrid BT/US approach, and increase character 
    AI quality for a range of tasks such as action and target selection. Attendees will learn how to get the most out 
    of modern spatial query systems with a combination of new techniques and best practices to maximize quality and 
    extend their application to new areas.

- title: "The How and Why of Server Validation for Mobile Simulations"
  description: >
    First we will discuss the how and the why of simple mobile simulation game economy, something that you 
    might find in every farming game. Then, we will spice it up with some real time decision making and how 
    it influences the challenge of server validation. We will have a look at how reusing code on server and 
    client, by implementing deterministic simulations, can make our life much easier. We wrap it up with an 
    extreme example where an economy and a battle is based on real time simulations. Expect to see technical 
    details about efficient data serialisation, how to implement deterministic simulations and much more.

- title: "Online Evolution for Hero Academy and Multi-Action Games"
  description: >
    Tree-search algorithms are widely used for decision making in turn-based strategy games. These algorithms 
    do however not perform well for games with millions of possible moves each turn. This talk will explain 
    and show how an evolutionary algorithm, that we call Online Evolution, is used to make a game-playing 
    agent for Hero Academy; a game with around 1 billion possible moves each turn. Online Evolution searches 
    the space of possible action sequences that make up a single turn of the game using a genetic algorithm. 
    This approach looks very promising for this class of game and has been shown to outperform several 
    standard tree-search algorithms.
