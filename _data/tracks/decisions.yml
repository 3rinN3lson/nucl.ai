  description: >
    A city siege battle is a complex machine of roles, responsibilities, and reactions on a large scale, 
    involving armies of hundreds or even thousands of individual men. This talk will cover the AI 
    architecture used in Total War: Warhammer to deal with the inherent complexities of this particular 
    battle type. We will cover the general Battle AI architecture before diving deep into specific examples 
    of the attacking Siege Battle AI. Finally, we will share some hard-earned development advice for AI programmers.
  speakers:
    - Andre Arsenault
