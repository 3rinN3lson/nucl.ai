- title: "It's All about Location: Expanding the Frontier of Spatial Query Systems in RPGs"
  description: >
    As spatial query systems such as EQS (Unreal Engine 4), TPS (CryEngine), and PQS (Luminous Studio) have matured, 
    auto-generated spatial queries are increasingly relied upon for robust dynamic position selection. We present a 
    series of techniques and extensions to these systems used by Square Enix to produce novel behaviors and improve 
    position selection in our current generation of AAA RPG titles. In addition, we have expanded UE4’s Environment 
    Query System to serve as a general-purpose utility system; we show how minor modifications allowed the team to 
    use EQS to coordinate combat, reduce behavior tree complexity with a hybrid BT/US approach, and increase character 
    AI quality for a range of tasks such as action and target selection. Attendees will learn how to get the most out 
    of modern spatial query systems with a combination of new techniques and best practices to maximize quality and 
    extend their application to new areas.

- title: "The How and Why of Server Validation for Mobile Simulations"
  description: >
    First we will discuss the how and the why of simple mobile simulation game economy, something that you 
    might find in every farming game. Then, we will spice it up with some real time decision making and how 
    it influences the challenge of server validation. We will have a look at how reusing code on server and 
    client, by implementing deterministic simulations, can make our life much easier. We wrap it up with an 
    extreme example where an economy and a battle is based on real time simulations. Expect to see technical 
    details about efficient data serialisation, how to implement deterministic simulations and much more.

- title: "Integrating Modern AI with no Leaps of Faith: What’s Your Next Step? [Panel]"
  description: >
    When you are faced with the challenge of decision making, you may choose among different techniques. Monte Carlo Tree Search, Deep Q Learning, Query Systems or even Evolutionary Algorithms can provide you with different ways of approaching the problem, and each one of them has its own advantages and disadvantages. How do you choose which one fits your problem better? What should you do, and what should you avoid? Can you combine these techniques, or switch from one to another dynamically? Join us at this panel to hear what do our experts think about this and learn from their tips and experiences.

- title: "Online Evolution for Hero Academy and Multi-Action Games"
  description: >
    Tree-search algorithms are widely used for decision making in turn-based strategy games. These algorithms 
    do however not perform well for games with millions of possible moves each turn. This talk will explain 
    and show how an evolutionary algorithm, that we call Online Evolution, is used to make a game-playing 
    agent for Hero Academy; a game with around 1 billion possible moves each turn. Online Evolution searches 
    the space of possible action sequences that make up a single turn of the game using a genetic algorithm. 
    This approach looks very promising for this class of game and has been shown to outperform several 
    standard tree-search algorithms.

- title: "Computer Go: from Influence Functions to AlphaGo" # Chess & Go
  description: >
    Computer Go is a game that has been used for many years as a challenge for AI. AlphaGo has received 
    significant press coverage lately, after achieving a victory that surprised many experts in the field. 
    But progress and work within the Go community, pushing the boundaries of research in this game, has 
    been steady over the years before this breakthrough. In this talk, we will review the progress and 
    paradigm shifts from the early days of computer Go to the recent victory of AlphaGo using Deep Learning 
    and Monte Carlo Tree Search, and we will outline possible future directions on this field.

  description: >
    ViZDoom is a Doom-based platform for research in visual learning and visual reinforcement learning, in particular. It allows developing bots that play DOOM using only the raw visual information.
    In this hands-on workshop, you will have an opportunity to experiment with ViZDoom, learn how to connect it with a deep Q-learning framework, and to train your own vision-only bot in a simple scenario.

- title: "Advances in Deep Reinforcement Learning"
  description: >
    The advances in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) allowed recently to obtain highly competent agents for, among others, Atari games and Go. Conveniently from the practical perspective, these methods involve little domain knowledge, being able to learn from raw visual information such as the game board or the screen buffer.
    After briefly introducing the reinforcement learning problem, the talk will overview the state-of-the-art methods and results in deep reinforcement learning. The final part will be devoted to the recent results in learning to play Doom from raw visual information.
