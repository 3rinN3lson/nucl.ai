- title: "TransProse: Generating Music From Literature"
  description: >
    TransProse is a program that generates music from novels. It works by identifying emotions throughout a novel, and using that underlying emotional structure to create musical pieces with the same emotional tone. In this talk Hannah will present the algorithm behind TransProse, discuss the process of generating music from data, and examine how the field of data sonification can be a valuable tool in artistic spaces.

- title: "Procedural Story & Level Generation using Tag-Based Content Selection"
  description: >
    Selecting the right bit of content based on what is happening is a key problem that appears in many parts of game development, be it NPC reactions, level generation, dynamic stories, or procedural text. It is at the core of interactive storytelling.
    Tag-based content selection is a powerful technique for solving this problem that was originally developed to pick AI barks in video games. It is still being used for that today, but it can also be used to generate levels, interactive fiction scenes, and more. It is easy to understand by both programmers and non-programmers, and is both powerful and practical.
    This talk will be a deep dive into tag-based content selection, to show how to implement it, how it can be used to generate content, why it is so powerful, what the pitfalls are, where it has been used, as well as various tips, tricks, tools, and refinements.

- title: "Computational Narrative Intelligence and the Quest for Human-Centered AI"
  description: >
    Storytelling is a pervasive part of the human experience--we as humans tell stories to communicate, inform, entertain, and educate. I hypothesize that narrative intelligence, the ability to understand, create, and respond affectively to narratives, can make it easier for artificial intelligence systems to understand humans and make it easier for humans to understand the behavior of artificial intelligence system. In this talk, I present research on machine learning approaches to story understanding, the creation of novel narrative structures, and using natural language stories to program robots. I will lay out a roadmap for the ways in which computational narrative intelligence can facilitate the creation of intelligent applications that benefit humans and facilitate human-agent interaction.
