# - title: "Dynamic Pricing in Mobile Games"
#   description: >
#     Dynamic pricing originated in the airline industry almost 50 years ago. Since then, it has spread to the hospitality 
#     industry, to consumer packaged goods, and to retail. The rise of In-App-Purchases within gaming (more generally, the 
#     rise of digital goods, bought and sold via mobile devices), and the rapid evolution of "big data" infrastructure, 
#     presents new challenges and opportunities for dynamic pricing, both in theory and in practice. The challenge is to make 
#     sense of large masses of noisy data, in a way that is actionable for "the business side of the house" (e.g. the people 
#     who set prices). The opportunity is to reinvent how we look at data, and automate the process of sifting for information. 
#     We can take notions that are intuitively "obvious" to old-school marketers (for example: "stickershock") or endlessly 
#     discussed in economic texts (for example: "Intertemporal Price Discrimination"), make them precise, and then see, 
#     automatically and across automatically derived clusters, whether the definitions actually capture actionable differences 
#     in consumer behavior.
#     In this talk, we will outline how Scientific Revenue approaches the problem of setting prices for In-App-Purchases in 
#     gaming, with illustrations and examples from the field.

# - title: "Fast > Perfect: Practical approximation examples for mobile game analytics using Spark Streaming"
#   description: >
#     For mobile games, constant tweaks are the difference between success and failure. 
#     Game designers need metrics like DAU, new users and ARPDAU in real-time to be able to tweak quickly. 
#     But calculating, for example, uniqueness or newness of a data point requires a list of seen data points - 
#     both memory intensive and tricky when using real-time stream processing like Spark Streaming. 
#     Probabilistic data structures allow approximation of these properties with a fixed memory representation 
#     and are very well suited for stream processing. 
#     Getting from the theory of approximation to a practical useful metric at a low error rate even for many millions of users 
#     is another story. In this talk we will look at ways to achieve it:
#     <ul>
#     <li>
#     Which approximation we use for selection of useful metrics
#     </li>
#     <li>
#     Why we picked a specific probabilistic data structure
#     </li>
#     <li>
#     How we store it in Cassandra as a time series
#     </li>
#     <li>
#     How we implemented it in Spark Streaming
#     </li>
#     </ul>

#- title: "Extending recommendation systems to offer a personalised in-game experience"
#  description: >
#    We will present the fundamentals and practical challenges of building a recommendation system for your online game, 
#    taking you through the established approaches of Collaborative Filtering, Content Based and Latent Factor based systems. 
#    After briefly discussing how to design, evaluate and deploy these algorithms we will demonstrate how recommendation 
#    systems can move beyond store front inventories to offer your players a personalised in-game experience. Currently 
#    deployed within RuneScape, the worldâ€™s largest free-to-play massively multiplayer online game, we will go behind the 
#    scenes and present the details of the "lucky challenge" system, an adaption of recommendation approaches to highlight 
#    personally relevant content to players exploring the world of Gielinor. Attempting to balance engagement, enjoyment and 
#    spend through a second-order set of real-time recommendations present unique challenges in terms of scalability, messaging, 
#    monitoring and algorithm design and our presentation will give a snapshot of our current solutions and future plans.

#- title: "Early churn prediction and personalised interventions"
#  description: >
#    How to tackle the problem of early churners, and define a strategy to overcome this issue. An approach to early churn 
#    prediction using machine learning algorithms is shared. Various machine learning models were tested, along with feature 
#    selection procedures. A clustering technique is introduced that segments users according to their first day gameplay habits. 
#    Also, a notification sending engine is described, which combines the knowledge gathered from the two previously mentioned 
#    methods, and targets the predicted churners with different types of personalized messages. This allows us to decrease early 
#    churn rate, while significantly increasing first day retention as well as boosting other metrics. We will also touch upon 
#    the underlying system infrastructure to deal with the scalability issues that occur when working with big data.
