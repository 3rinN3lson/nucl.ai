- title: "Late to the Party! A Story of Adding Player Bots to a Humans-Only Game"
  description: >
    Paragon is the latest MOBA game from Epic Games. Late in production a decision has been made to add player bots to support single-player and practice matches. The talk is going to describe how adding reasonable bot players to a game build around human players has been achieved. The approach taken consisted of both using stock UE4 AI parts as well as creating performant, game-specific AI subsystems, so there's going to be something interesting for everybody!

- title: "Functional Reactive Programming, or the art of Time Travel(ling Debuggers)"
  description: >
    In 2012, Bret Victor's talk "Inventing on Principle" showed the ideal future of debugging: time travel. Being able to scrub through all the past states of your program, fix the bug, hot-reload the code and see the change applied to all the past states as well.
    Since then, only one implementation of it has appeared, for Elm, a Functional Reactive Programming language.
    FRP makes Time Travelling debuggers much cheaper to implement, making them viable for actual game development.
    In this talk we'll look at how to use FRP and time travelling debuggers to make agent-based games.
