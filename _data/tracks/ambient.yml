- title: "The Evolution of Crowds and AI in Feature Film Animation"
  description: >
    At Pixar, crowds are important because they provide spectacle, make worlds more realistic and react believably to the 
    character’s action. But they’re also hard to do! So if you want to know more about how Pixar Animation Studios created 
    crowds for Cars 2, Ratatouille and Up, Paul's talk will lead you through crowd pipelines for feature films, highlighting AI 
    usages in service of Animation.

- title: "Building the massive crowds of Assassin’s Creed Unity"
  description: >
    With the limit of 40 real AIs and 120 high resolution models, we could create scenes in Assassin’s Creed Unity where 10000 
    crowd NPCs are on screen at the same time. In this presentation, we will introduce a new technique of AI Level of Detail 
    that has allowed us to create thousands of replicated, persistent, interactive NPCs at very low cost. We will go over how 
    we created a pooling system that allowed us to swap a small number of legacy NPC with cheap low resolution NPCs without the 
    player noticing. This talk will then explain how to create a simplistic AI brain to handle the behavior systems of the cheap 
    NPCs. We will also give insights on the problems that came with integrating this technology in a huge legacy system.
