#- title: "Behavior design for an operational military simulation"
#  description: >
#    For armies, training is both very important and expensive and potentially dangerous to do in the real worlds; 
#    the use of simulations is therefore widespread. When using simulations to confront trainees to face complex situations, 
#    the modeling of realistic automated forces becomes essential. This implies the construction of behavior models 
#    to make automated forces behave in the simulated environment.
#    This talk will focus on this construction process, from the analysis of military doctrine and the end user needs 
#    to the behavior modeling by specialists and finally the test and validation process. 
#    MASA SWORD, a simulation for command post training used by many armies throughout will serve as an illustration for 
#    this presentation.

#- title: "Orchestration of virtual environments for training in complex sociotechnical situations"
#  description: >
#    The current state-of-the-art on virtual environments allows us to envision their use for training purposes. 
#    We can conceive autonomous worlds where learners can experiment, discover and learn the outcomes of their decisions. 
#    Though, it is important that this autonomy stay manageable to achieve pedagogical relevance and coherency of the world.

#    The talk will present the HUMANS platform (Human models based Artificial eNvironments Software platform) whose purpose is
#    to dynamically orchestrate a virtual environment towards learning situations without impairing the world coherency nor the
#    emergence of new and unpredicted situations. The HUMANS platform relies on the modelling of human and social activities
#    leveraging highly complex artificial intelligence techniques in various domains, such as knowledge representation (ontologies),
#    uncertainty processing in complex systems and decisional artificial intelligence (automated planning, plan recognition, multiagent systems).
