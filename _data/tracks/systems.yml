# - title: "Designing CAD tools for novices: can algorithms enhance productivity or foster creativity?"
#   description: >
#    As the number and the size of computer games continues to expand, game companies handle rising demand by extending their cadre, 
#    compressing development cycles and reusing code or assets. To limit development time and reduce the cost of content creation, 
#    commercial game engines and procedural content generation are popular shortcuts among game companies. Low-level engine features 
#      such as physics simulation and game-independent content such as vegetation are often handled by third-party middleware. 
#      For content more contingent on a game's theme, mechanics and quests, most commercial game engines assist in the fast and intuitive 
#      creation of game levels and scripts via game editors which automate mundane tasks such as pathfinding. Computer-aided design tools 
#      are used in almost all creative tasks in order to minimize development time and cost, reduce human effort, support collaboration among 
#      members of a design team or elicit a user's creativity.

#      While computer-aided design tools are extending their functionalities to allow for the creation of more and more elaborate and complete games, 
#      the learning curve for a novice user becomes steeper. This talk will present methods for using Artificial Intelligence to assist a novice user 
#      in getting acquainted with the interface and the task of designing, as well as automate the more tedious or challenging development tasks. 
#      The talk will cover mixed-initiative design where both the human and the computer proactively contribute to the problem solution, although 
#      the two initiatives do not need to contribute to the same degree. Mixed-initiative design tools should both support a user in their design 
#      process (enhancing productivity) but also contribute with novel ideas (fostering creativity). In the generation of such ideas, a mixed-initiative 
#      tool should recognize the user's intentions, aesthetic preferences and design process; its suggestions should either be the next logical step 
#      towards the user's perceived goal or present an unexpected alternative which the designer hadn't thought of. In order to make either type of 
#      suggestion meaningful, the computer must be able to capture the user's perceptual and cognitive mechanisms, and apply this knowledge to incite 
#      the creativity of the designer. The talk will conclude with promising directions (and low-hanging fruit) for commercial tool development wishing 
#      to incorporate AI-assisted and mixed-initiative design paradigms.
