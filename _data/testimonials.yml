    I've never seen so many industry figures, academics, and students 
    happy to discuss a range of topics around AI in games. It was really, 
    REALLY helpful.

    It was my first time at #nuclai15 and I heard about it very late through 
    co-workers. I was mostly interested in the Character Animation panels. 
    I really hope to be able to attend every year from now on! Great 
    information, great people, great time!

    For the first time in my life,  I left a conference with concrete and crystallized
    plans to improve my current project based on the talks I attended and the 
    conversations I had with people. Incredibly. Useful.

    Spent months of saving and talking to Alex on twitter â€“ it 
    was more than worth it. I cannot express how this experience changed 
    me and might as well have shaped my future. From the networks I've created to
    the feedback needed to get back on track I am extremely happy for this 
    opportunity and #nuclai16 is on my calendar.

    #nuclai15 was really unique and cross-discipline, bringing feature film, 
    game AI, animation and machine learning people and talks together makes 
    it the perfect opportunity to learn for everyone.

    conversations.
