            <p>Generally speaking, <a href="/">nucl.ai</a> is made up of nine day-long tracks on specific topics, with three running in parallel each day over three days.  The current topics are as follows, and will be finalized by May 1st when single-day tickets become available:</p>

            <p>Each of these tracks consists of an inspiring keynote and/or presentations from high-profile applications, specialized masterclasses and in-depth tutorials, panel discussions and expert Q&amp;A, and (if applicable) an open laboratory in workshop-style.  The different types of sessions are scheduled in different rooms throughout the day.</p>
