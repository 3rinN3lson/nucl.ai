Public transport: U3 or U1 “Stephansplatz”


Time Travel Vienna
https://www.timetravel-vienna.at/en/
“2000 years of Viennese history brought to life” 
This is a very tourist-y attraction, borderline cheesy. However friends have assured us, it’s so over the top it is actually rather good fun. 

Public transport: U3 “Herrengasse”, U1 “Stephansplatz” or bus 2A “Habsburgergasse”
