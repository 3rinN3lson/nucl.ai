            <p>Generally speaking, <a href="http://nucl.ai/">nucl.ai</a> is made up of nine day-long tracks on specific topics, with three running in parallel each day over three days.  The current topics are as follows, and will be finalized by May 1st when single-day tickets become available:</p>

            <div class="thumbnails">
            {% for topic in site.data.topics %}
                <item class="thumbnail topic-{{topic.id}}">
                    <thumbnail-wrap>
                    {% capture thumbnail %}/img/topics/{{ topic.id }}.jpeg{% endcapture %}
                    <thumbnail name="{{topic.title}}" style="background-image: url('{{ thumbnail |  prepend: site.baseurl }}')">
                    </thumbnail>
                    </thumbnail-wrap>
                    <h3 class="thumbnail-title" name="{{topic.title}}">{{ topic.title }}</h3>
                </item>
            {% endfor %}
            </div>

            <p>Each of these tracks consists of an inspiring keynote and/or presentations from high-profile applications, specialized masterclasses and in-depth tutorials, panel discussions and expert Q&amp;A, as well as open laboratory in workshop-style.  Each of these different types of sessions are scheduled in different rooms through out the day...</p>

                <p>The upper room at the University of Vienna's "Hörsaalzentrum" will host hundreds of attendees over three days.  Drawing from a rotation of <a href="http://nucl.ai/#topics">all event tracks</a>, multiple types of talks will be featured there:</p>
