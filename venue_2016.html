<h2>Public transport near venue</h2>
<p>
Subway: U2 Schottentor (purple line), U3 Herrengasse (orange line, a bit further away)</br>
Tram: D, 1, 2, 37, 38, 30, 41, 42, 43, 44, 71</br>
Bus: 1A</p>


<h2>Tickets for public transport</h2>
<p>You can get all of the tickets mentioned below at the red ticket machine in every subway station (english language option available)</p>

<p>The best choice of ticket depends when you arrive in Vienna, those are your best options:</p>


<h3>Arriving Sunday:</h3>
<p><a href="https://shop.wienerlinien.at/index.php/product/7/show/0/0/0/0/buy" target="_blank">Weekly ticket</a>: Monday (starting at Sunday midnight) - Monday (09:00): 16,20€</p>


<p>You will need to cover Sunday afternoon as well, which would probably be best with "<a href="https://shop.wienerlinien.at/index.php/product/35/show/0/0/0/0/buy" target="_blank">Single trip tickets</a>".
1 direction trip (you can switch between different modes or lines ) = 2,20€ </p>


<h3>Arriving earlier/ staying longer:</h3>

<p>
<b> <a href="https://shop.wienerlinien.at/index.php/product/42/show/0/0/0/0/buy" target="_blank">8 day ticket</a></b></br>
This ticket gives you 8 seperate days for 38,40€, not bound to a person or timeframe ( (you can split the ticket for 8 persons on 1 day, 2 person 4 days...) </br>
1 day for 1 person costs you 4,80€.</p>




<h2>Airport</h2>

<h3>Train</h3>

<p>
<b>Regular Train:</b> </br>
“Schnellbahn”, S7, direction “Wien Mitte” or “Wien Floridsdorf” </br>
1 way ticket for 4,40€/ 1 Person, 2 Person for 4,60€ (discount is applied automatically at ticket machine), all destinations in Vienna will cost you the same
</p>
<p>
Best to take the train to “Wien Mitte” and switch to the subway there. Don’t forget to get a ticket for Vienna’s public transport when switching.
</p>
<p>
CAT: fastest way into the city </br>
CAT is around 5-7 minutes faster then the regular train (16 minutes), 1 stop, 1 way ticket 11€
</p>
<p>
Both trains leave directly from the airport Vienna, both running at a 30 minute frequency
</p>


<h3><a href="http://www.viennaairport.com/en/passengers/arrival__parking/bus_connections" target="_blank">Bus</a></h3>
<p>
Busses are running outside the arrival terminal in Vienna, taking you to 3 different locations in Vienna, at 8€ cost per person.
</p>


<h3>Cabs</h3>

<p><b>“Yellow” cabs</b></br>
You can find cabs outside the arrival terminal at the airport, a drive to the center will cost you around 40-50€, running the taximeter.</p>

<p><b>Airport driver</b></br>
You can find specialised airport driver inside in the arrival terminal (left hand side before going down to the train station), those offer fixed rate transports, starting at 37€. They might be booked completely, but it’s worth checking, if you prefer to take a cab.</p>

        For transport from / to the airport use this <a href="http://fahrplan.oebb.at/bin/query.exe/en" target="_blank">page</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
        To get around in Vienna and for public transportation help we recommend "QANDO VIENNA":
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fluidtime.qando"> For Andoid </a></li>
            <li><a target="_blank" href="https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/qando/id315777736?mt=8"> For iOS </a></li>
            <li><a target="_blank" href="http://m.qando.at/wl_qando_mobileweb/routeSelect"> For Web Browser </a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        Be careful! Google Maps hasn't fully integrated public transport for Vienna yet, this is why we are suggesting to use Qando.
