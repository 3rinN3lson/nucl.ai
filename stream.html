                <h3>The Event</h3>
                
                <p>Of course, if you're interested in any of the sessions above you should <a href="/attend/">attend in-person</a>!  Here are many reasons why:</p>
                
                <ol style="opacity: 0.85;">
                    <li><b>On-Site Only Sessions</b> &mdash; The masterclass room features in-depth tutorials and more advanced topics, and will not be streamed.  Also, the hands-on workshop only make sense if you attend in person and won't be recorded.  Consider visiting us!<br/><br/></li>
                    <li><b>Career Opportunities</b> &mdash; If you're looking to make a transition into artificial intelligence, nucl.ai is the place you jump to the front of the queue. Whether you're a student or looking for options, there's no substitute for meeting your future colleagues directly!<br/><br/></li>
                    <li><b>Networking &amp; Building Contacts</b> &mdash; The community at nucl.ai is very friendly, and the event is a great & easy way to meet new friends, build up your professional network, and like-minded people to contact in the future.<br/><br/></li>
                    <li><b>Recruiting and Hiring</b> &mdash; For studios or companies keen to hire, nucl.ai is one of the best places to start since it's a conference focusing on developers, not CEOs or marketers!  Meeting those programmers and designers in person one of the best ways to hire.<br/><br/></li>
                </ol>
                
                <p>If you need any help or advice with any of this, the conference team is always happy to help.  Our hands-on workshops are great ways to meet others without any pressure.  The various social events, both official and unofficial, will also let you relax in great company.</p>
