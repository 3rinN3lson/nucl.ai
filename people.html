<p>For more than 6 years Clodéric has tried to make simulated characters behave "autonomously AND as they are told to". At Golaem, he worked on a navigation engine used, for example, in a train passengers simulation and a crowd simulation tool for animation and vfx. Now working on MASA LIFE, he is dedicated to make behavior authoring easy, fun and accessible to game designers and field experts.</p>
