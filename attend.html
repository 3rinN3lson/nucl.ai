            <p>The audience at nucl.ai is made up of a diverse and welcoming community of developers.  Not everyone is an expert in Artificial Intelligence (nor do you need to be), but everyone shares the interest for complex systems, intelligent tools, autonomous agents or their underlying algorithms.</p>
            
            <p>Whether you're a professional or hobbyist interested (for example) in how design must evolve to cope with emergence, which techniques can help create innovative applications, and why content creation is changing with modern tools, you'll find a group of friends at nucl.ai</p>
