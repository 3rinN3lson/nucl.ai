                For the 2015 edition of the conference we will be back at the University of Vienna, with its welcoming campus and excellent facilities:
                </p>
                <p>
                Campus Altes AKH<br>
                Hörsaalzentrum<br>
                Spitalgasse 2<br>
                1090 Vienna, AUSTRIA
                </p>
                <p>
                Important: The venue is at the <b>Campus in the 9th district</b>, NOT the main University building in the 1st district.
                </p>
                <p>
                The Hörsaalzentrum is located in the second court of the Campus Altes AKH. It's a large glass building enclosed within a large inner courtyard surrounded by other University buildings. You can enter the courtyard at most corners, or usually near the tram stops.

                The trip from the Vienna airport will take you between 45 minutes and an 1 hour. From the airport catch the S7 train to Landstraße / Wien Mitte, then the subway U4 direction Heiligenstadt and get off at Friedensbrücke. Finally take the tram 33 direction Josephstädter Strasse and get off at Lange Gasse. One €4.40 ticket will get you all the way from the airport to the university campus.
                </p>
                <p>
                From the airport, you can also grab the CAT train to Landstrasse / Wien Mitte, which is heavily advertised and hard to miss but it's much more expensive (€11 or €17 return).
