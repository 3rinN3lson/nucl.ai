    <h2>The Conference Venue</h2>
    <grid>
        <content>
            <p>
                For the 2015 edition of the conference we will be back at the University of Vienna, with its welcoming campus and excellent facilities:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                Campus Altes AKH<br>
                Hörsaalzentrum<br>
                Spitalgasse 2<br>
                1090 Vienna, AUSTRIA
            </blockquote>
                <img src="/img/venue/glasswall.jpg"/>
            <p>
                <u>IMPORTANT</u>: The venue is at the <b>Campus in the 9th district</b>, NOT the main University building in the 1st district. It's nice to visit the center of town, but do so intentionally!
            </p>
            <p>
                The Hörsaalzentrum is located in the second court of the Campus Altes AKH. It's a large glass building enclosed within a large inner courtyard surrounded by other University buildings. You can enter the courtyard at most corners, or usually near the tram stops.

    <h2>Travelling to the Campus</h2>

                <h3>From Vienna Airport</h3>
                <p>
                The trip from the Vienna airport will take you between 45 minutes and an 1 hour. Catch the S7 train to LANDSTRASSE/ WIEN MITTE from the airport, then the subway U4 (green) direction Heiligenstadt and get off at FRIEDENSBRÜCKE. Finally take the tram 5 direction JOSEPHSTÄDTER STRASSE and get off at LANGE GASSE.
                One €4.40 ticket will get you all the way from the airport to the university campus. There are ticket machines BEFORE you go down to the platform at which you can purchase your ticket. You need to get your ticket BEFORE getting on the train.
                </p>
                <p>
                From the airport, you can also grab the CAT train to LANDSTRASSE / WIEN MITTE, which is heavily advertised and hard to miss but it's much more expensive (€11 or €17 return).
                (Airport = "Flughafen" in German)
                </p>
                <h3>Using Public Transport</h3>
                <p>
                There is more than one way to get to the venue, depending on where in Vienna you are staying. You can buy one way tickets directly IN the tram (cash only). There are also short term passes available. You can get all tickets at ticket machines located in the subway stops (<a href="http://www.wienerlinien.at/eportal2/ep/channelView.do/pageTypeId/66533/channelId/-47643" target="_blank">Ticket Guide</a>).
                </p>
                <p>
                The lines that take you directly to the venue are:
                Trams 5, 43, 44 (Stop LANGE GASSE)
                </p>

                <p>
                The Subway U2 (purple) RATHAUS takes you near the venue with approximately 15 minutes walking time.
                </p>

                <p>
                Alternatively you can take U2 (purple) to SCHOTTENTOR and take the trams 43 or 44 for two stops and get off at LANGE GASSE. Schottentor is the final stop, so you don't have to worry about the direction.

                <p>
                If your hotel is located in the west of Vienna you can take U3 (orange) or U6 (brown) to WESTBAHNHOF and take the tram 5 from there to LANGE GASSE.
                </p>
                <p>
                Westbahnhof is the final stop, so you don't have to worry about the direction.

                NOTE: You can download a

                of the subways and suburban trains in Vienna as a large PDF (1.8MB) to help plan your journey.

                <h3>Taxis &amp; Cabs</h3>
                <p>
                In Austria you can flag down flags quite easily in the streets, just keep an eye out for cars with a lit taxi sign. Vienna's taxi fee is a combination of stand-fee and a running taxometer.
                Most cabs accept Credit Cards as well, best is to ask upfront and watch out for the stickers on the windows.

        <p>
        To get around in Vienna and for public transportation help we recommend "QANDO VIENNA":
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fluidtime.qando"> For Andoid </a></li>
            <li><a target="_blank" href="https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/qando/id315777736?mt=8"> For iOS </a></li>
            <li><a target="_blank" href="http://m.qando.at/wl_qando_mobileweb/routeSelect"> For Web Browser </a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        Be careful! Google Maps hasn't fully integrated public transport for Vienna yet, this is why we are suggesting to use Qando.
